Using Flashcard as a teaching aid is a playful means to introduce children to new words, pictures and other informational items.

Our proposed JIKA platform is comprised of two sections, namely, the “Educational Content Providers Section” who significantly enrich and diversify the “Flashcards Archive” and “User Section” for Parents & Teachers who are end users would Peak-Personalize-Pack & Print selected Augmented Reality-Flashcards from the Archive

Applicants at user section have access to their needed flashcards with Augmented Reality capability for free. Although Some of contents may not be accessible for applicants before they pay inexpensive rights determined by the content provider. Since JIKA is supposed to be the most competitive marketplace for non-free contents, we expect this kind of contents can be accessible with a reasonable and low-cost fee.

The JIKA Platform’s innovative and collaborative teaching aid including its Augmented Reality mobile application furnishes all its beneficiaries with a more interesting learning process using its Augmented Reality capability. It also ever increasingly benefits from competition among content providers including 2D/3D Designers and any creative producers who endeavor to present more attractive educational contents.
